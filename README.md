### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare data

### Description
This Python program provides useful insight into the bikeshare programs of the selected US Cities. At the moment the data sets are for New York City, Washington DC and Chicago. When the program is run, the user will be asked to select a city, whether to filter by month or day of the week and the program will then run until the user decides to exit.

Some preset analysis will be performed for the data and the filters selected.

### Files used
bikeshare.py
chicaco.csv

### Credits
The Udacity instructors provided the template with the starting main function and some of the other function "shells".
